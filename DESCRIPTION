Description: BAD-ZUPA (Bayesian Approach for Detrital Zircon U-Pb ages) is a new evaluation protocol based on Riihimaki and Vehtari (2014)'s Laplace approximation with logistic Gaussian process regression (LA-LGP). BAD-ZUPA evaluates the probability density function (PDF) and their integration, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) through two algorithms: (I) confidence interval estimation and (II) peaks estimation. With BAD-ZUPA we can evaluate the confidence we have on a detrital zircon spectrum and the significance of the observed peaks. In addition, BAD-ZUPA is a powerful tool to estimate how many more zircons we would need to analyze to obtain a desired level of confidence.
